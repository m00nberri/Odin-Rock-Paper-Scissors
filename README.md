# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors

Updated and stylized Rock Paper Scissors (Janken in Japan) for the Odin project.

I spent entirely too much time on this but I really liked the idea I had and waned to see it finished.

I turned the rock paper scissors game into a very basic fighting game.
The player chooses a character and the computer chooses one from the remaining selection and both fight it out used standard rock paper scissors rules.
Each loss in a round results in a loss of one HP, causing the health bar of the play to shrink.
First to 0 HP loses.

I learned a lot about manipulating the DOM while completing this project, and different interesting ways CSS properties can be manipulated with JS.
The code is very spaghetti-y, and by the end I figured out I could have written the initial parts of my JS file a lot cleaner, but I had already spent so much time on it. Maybe I can go back and revisit this much later and clean it up.

I hope you enjoy playing it!
Feel free to send me any bugs you find.
